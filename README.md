# Local AI

Local AI is a cutting-edge web application that leverages the new Chrome API `window.ai` to run an AI model directly in the user's browser. This allows for enhanced performance, privacy, and user control over AI-driven features.

You can try it out by visiting [local-ai.pages.dev](https://local-ai.pages.dev/), or by following the installation instructions below to run it locally on your machine.

## Features

- **Local AI Execution**: Run AI models locally in your browser, ensuring data privacy and faster processing times.
- **Open Source**: The source code is freely available for anyone to review, modify, and contribute to.
